Hi, I’m @ale-blanco-dev, 


👀 I’m interested in quality assurance, cloud computing, and performance testing.

🌱 I’m currently learning AWS and K6. My main sources of information are online courses and platform documentation.

🌟 "Respect others as you would like to be treated." This is my daily motto.

⚡ Fun fact: I love doing puzzles.
