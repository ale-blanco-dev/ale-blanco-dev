Hi, I’m @ale-blanco-dev, 
👀 I’m interested in quality assurance, cloud computing, and performance testing.
🌱 I’m currently learning AWS and I hope to start learning K6 soon. My main sources of information are online courses and platform documentation.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on QA projects, especially those involving cloud infrastructure and performance testing.
📫 How to reach me: You can contact me via LinkedIn messaging or email me at [sofiablancosanchez0@gmail.com].
🌟 "Respect others as you would like to be treated." This is my daily motto.
⚡ Fun fact: I love learning in my free time and building LEGO sets.
